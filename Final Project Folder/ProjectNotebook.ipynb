    "* I wanted to create a class Card that has a suit attribute and a value attribute that I can then use later in my Deck class. Additionally, I wanted you to be able to create your own valid Cards to perhaps make your own list of Cards if you did not want to use a full deck\n",
    "\n",
    "* I created a class Deck that builds a full deck of 52 standard playing cards with their valid suits and values. The Deck object allows you to draw any number of cards randomly from the deck and removes them from the available cards to draw. The cards you drew are then added to a draw pile. You can view the cards that have been drawn from the deck as well as the remaining cards left in the deck. At any point you can restack the deck to be a full deck and get rid of all of the drawn cards if you are done using them."
